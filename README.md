# html_fic_parser
This program takes an html file downloaded from the dowload function on Archive of Our Own and splits it into smaller chapter html files.

I've recently gotten into typesetting fanfictions for both ebook and binding. The current workflow I've observed in fanfiction book binding community involves copying and pasting each chapter individually from Ao3. This has some downsides as far as time: selecting all whilst not selecting things like the banner of Ao3 is difficult, ditto for author's comments. My program is an attempt to improve upon this.

With this program all you have to do is hit the download buttom on the fic of your choice and press html as format. Then change the file path location to where you've saved the html document and run the program. The program should output html files for each chapter that only include the chapter title and text perfect for opening in your browser of choice and selecting all.
